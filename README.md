# Design Patterns in C++

A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occuring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finised design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

This repo contains some C++ examples for classic design patterns.
